# Discord Timestamps

Takes a time from user input and generates time tags for Discord. Using time tags will automatically display that time in the end user's local time zone.

For example `<t:1696390200:t>` will display as "11:30 PM" for users in New York, and will display as "8:30 PM" for users in California.

Thanks to [this pastebin page](https://pastebin.com/rJFE9yxq) for the tags.
